To send fortune.html to our client, weâ€™ll write a view function and send it when the page is requested.

Inside the randomfortune app, open views.py. Define a new function named fortune() that takes a single parameter, request.
 In fortune(), return the render function with two arguments, the request and the path to fortune.html as a string,
  "randomfortune/fortune.html".


Hint
The fortune() function will look similar to:

def myView(request):
  return (request, "myApp/myTemplate.html")
